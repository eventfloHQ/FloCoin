# Tokenomics & FloCoin Utility

### **What is FloCoin?**

FloCoin is the BSC utility token that powers the eventflo platform, driving value exchange, incentivization, and access to exclusive features within the ecosystem. Designed to enhance engagement, rewards, and platform growth, FloCoin supports the entire eventflo ecosystem and ensures a seamless experience for event organizers, artists, and attendees alike.

### **Utility of FloCoin**

**Ticketing Transactions & Flexibility:**

FloCoin allows event organizers to sell tickets and accept payments in FloCoin, fiat, or stablecoins. Organizers have the flexibility to either **keep the payments in FloCoin for instant withdrawals** or **convert them to fiat** before withdrawing, just like traditional ticket platforms. This flexibility supports both **price stability** within the ecosystem and ease of use, allowing organizers and attendees to transact in the currency that suits them best. Additionally, using FloCoin ensures **verifiable, fraud-proof NFT tickets**, adding an extra layer of security to the process.

**Staking & Governance (VeFlo):**

FloCoin holders can stake their tokens through VeFlo, supporting network security, liquidity, and efficiency. In return, stakers earn additional FloCoin, promoting long-term commitment to the platform. Staking also provides users with governance rights, allowing them to vote on key proposals that shape eventflo’s development. This decentralized structure ensures that stakers play an active role in guiding the platform’s evolution.

**Payments for Platform Tools & Services:**

FloCoin serves as a currency for accessing premium event management tools such as marketing automation, CRM, SMS and analytics dashboards. Organizers who use FloCoin to pay for these services receive exclusive discounts and added perks, increasing the token's utility beyond ticketing transactions. These payments create a seamless financial ecosystem within eventflo, encouraging greater token adoption.

**Event Ecosystem Partnerships & Real-World Utility:**

FloCoin enables users to access exclusive offers through partnerships with major brands, venues, and artists. These collaborations allow users to redeem FloCoin for VIP experiences, discounted tickets, merchandise, and other exclusive perks, providing real-world value to token holders. Staking FloCoin also offers priority access to these benefits, incentivizing both token holding and platform engagement.

**Gamified Engagement & Ecosystem Rewards:**

FloCoin boosts engagement by offering rewards through tokens bought back from the platform. Users earn FloCoin by attending events, referring new users, completing challenges, and purchasing tickets, while event organizers are rewarded through a dedicated fund. Organizers who sell more tickets and continue using the eventflo platform over time are recognized with additional token rewards. The better the events, the more tickets sold, the more tokens they earn. This system incentivizes both organizers and users, making the platform dynamic and driving sustained adoption and community growth.

**Data-Driven Insights & Organizer Benefits:**

Event organizers using FloCoin for ticket sales gain access to real-time data on attendee behavior and spending patterns. This data can be used to target specific demographics for future marketing efforts, enhancing event profitability and attendee satisfaction. By analyzing this data, organizers can offer personalized promotions, making FloCoin an invaluable tool for driving business success.

**Gasless Transactions & Network Stability:**

FloCoin powers transactions within the eventflo ecosystem, with eventflo covering all gas fees for attendees to create a seamless, gasless environment. This ensures users aren’t burdened by blockchain transaction costs. For organizers, FloCoin helps maintain network stability by facilitating payments between fiat, stablecoins, and FloCoin, supporting demand and utility throughout the platform.

**Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA):**
FloCoin enables the tokenization of event infrastructure like staging, lighting, and screens. These assets are minted as NFTs on the BNB Chain, allowing fractional ownership. Revenue from renting these assets is distributed to token holders via smart contracts, creating a transparent and lucrative ecosystem.

**Decentralized Ticket Insurance:**
FloCoin powers on-chain ticket insurance, where attendees can purchase protection during checkout. Refund requests are verified through an oracle system, and valid claims are automatically distributed via smart contracts. This innovation boosts buyer confidence and increases ticket sales for organizers. The system is available cross-platform, expanding blockchain utility beyond eventflo.

### **Token Distribution for FloCoin**

FloCoin has a total supply of 15,000,000 tokens. Below is a breakdown of the token allocation, including vesting schedules, and information on how the tokens will be utilized to drive the success and growth of the eventflo platform.

### **Detailed Allocation of FloCoin**

**Liquidity Pool (14%)**

**Purpose:** This pool ensures sufficient liquidity for FloCoin, stabilizing market prices and enabling smooth transactions. It allows both new and experienced participants to access the token without disrupting the market.

**Management:** The liquidity pool will be managed dynamically to respond to market demand and conditions, ensuring that there are always enough tokens available for trading and providing stability.

**Pre-Seed, Seed & Strategic Rounds  (20%)**

**Purpose:** These pools are reserved for early investors, who provide the initial capital needed for platform development. By participating early, these investors align with eventflo’s long-term growth and success, thanks to a structured vesting schedule.

**Strategic Importance:** Early investors bring not only financial resources but also valuable strategic insights and connections. Their vesting schedule ensures that they remain committed to eventflo's long-term vision and growth.

**Public (10%)**

**Purpose:** The public sale offers broader access to FloCoin, allowing retail investors and community members to become part of the project from the start. This allocation is designed to ensure early participation and engagement with the platform.

**Function:** At the Token Generation Event (TGE), 30% of the tokens in this pool will be released immediately, with the remaining 70% vested over a 6-month period without any cliff. This gradual release supports liquidity and price stability while providing early investors with a structured entry, helping FloCoin gain traction in the market.

**Marketing & Partnerships (5%)**

**Purpose:** This pool is reserved for strategic collaborations with partners, influencers, and event organizers. These partnerships are critical for expanding eventflo’s reach and driving adoption.

**Utility:** Tokens are distributed gradually to key partners to promote long-term engagement and ensure that eventflo maintains visibility and credibility within the event industry and beyond.

**Ecosystem Reserves (18%) – DAO Driven**

**Purpose:** This allocation is dedicated to funding the ongoing development and scaling of the eventflo platform. However, to ensure flexibility, the use of these funds will be managed by a **DAO**, allowing the community to vote on when and how the ecosystem reserves are used.

**Use Case:** The DAO allows the eventflo community to unlock tokens from this pool as needed for platform upgrades, strategic partnerships, and business operations. This ensures both transparency and a flexible approach to sustaining platform growth.

**Team & Development (17%)**

**Purpose:** This allocation incentivizes the eventflo team and advisors, who are integral to the platform’s success. By providing long-term incentives, it ensures alignment with the project’s growth and sustainability.

**Long-Term Incentive:** A 6-month cliff followed by a 36-month vesting schedule ensures that team members are rewarded for their continued contributions while maintaining focus on the platform's long-term success.

**Rewards & Incentives (16%) – Demand Function Driven**

**Purpose:** This pool is specifically designed to reward event organizers for their success. Organizers who run more events and sell more tickets will earn additional FloCoin. The allocation will be governed by a **demand function** contract, ensuring that rewards are distributed automatically based on clear, pre-determined criteria.

**User Rewards:** Attendees and users will be rewarded through FloCoin buybacks, giving them additional tokens for engagement and participation, driving continuous involvement within the ecosystem. This rewards pool ensures both event organizers and attendees benefit from participating in the platform.

### **Initial Circulation (TGE)**

At the Token Generation Event (TGE), approximately 10.8% of the total supply (1,625,963 tokens) will enter circulation, primarily from the public and presale allocations.

### **Deflationary Mechanisms**

**Unstaking Burn:** As part of the staking mechanism, unstaking FloCoin tokens before the maturity term will incur a penalty. This penalty serves two purposes: **50% of the penalized amount** will be redirected to **refill the rewards pool**, ensuring that there are always sufficient tokens available to reward users for their contributions to the platform. The remaining **50% will be permanently burned**, reducing the total supply of FloCoin over time and helping maintain the stability and security of the network. This split ensures that both the sustainability of the rewards system and the long-term health of the platform are supported.

**Network Stability Fund: e**ventflo will allocate a percentage of its revenue each quarter to a Network Stability Fund to ensure the platform's liquidity and operational efficiency. This fund plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health of the network by supporting essential functions such as liquidity management and ensuring smooth operations. The buyback mechanism will operate in the background, with excess tokens being burned when necessary to maintain balance and stability, without overly emphasizing the "buyback and burn" aspect. This allows the network to operate efficiently while minimizing concerns about fund management and access.

### **Minting and Wallet Transparency**

All 15,000,000 FloCoin tokens will be minted at the launch, with the majority being locked in a **decentralized vault** that automates token unlocks and releases according to the vesting schedule. No individual or entity will have exclusive access to these tokens, ensuring full transparency and security. The vault operates through smart contracts, following the predetermined release schedule, and links to each wallet will be provided at TGE, allowing the community to track the flow and distribution of tokens in real-time.

**Liquidity Locking**

To ensure a healthy token economy and facilitate seamless transactions, FloCoin will maintain strong liquidity across exchanges, allowing for smooth token transactions and ensuring **good liquidity depth**. The locking period is set for a period of 60 months, extending as needed to reduce risk. This approach minimizes volatility and supports a stable market environment.

This demonstrates the eventflo team is fully committed to the long-term growth and success of the FloCoin token and the broader eventflo ecosystem.

### **Token Distribution Timeline Post-Public Listing**

The allocation of FloCoin across various pools is carefully structured to ensure the platform’s long-term sustainability and success. Each token pool plays a crucial role in supporting strategic initiatives, driving adoption, and maintaining the stability of both FloCoin and the eventflo platform. This efficient deployment of tokens maximizes the platform's impact over time and aligns with key demand events in our roadmap.

### **FloCoin Emission Schedule**

The FloCoin emission schedule is carefully aligned with major demand drivers and events in the eventflo roadmap to mitigate selling pressure at critical times. By staggering the release through well-defined vesting periods for investors, team members, and other stakeholders, FloCoin ensures a balanced and controlled supply post-listing. This strategic distribution helps stabilize the price while supporting the network’s long-term health and scalability as it grows..
